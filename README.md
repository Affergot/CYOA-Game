Choose Your Own Adventure Game!

# Introduction
This Choose Your Own Adventure Game was a collaborative project for a college class. The goal was to be able to work with a teammate to share and work on code remotely.
The game is rather simple and runs on Python command line, and our team of two scored extra marks for creativity and clean code.
